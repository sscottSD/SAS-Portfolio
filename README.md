  <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/sscottSD/SAS-Portfolio/blob/main/project1.sas">Project 1 Code</a>
    <p>
    Project one was challenging in adapting to the data workflows in SAS. There were some particular challenges in this project
    with formatting and consistency of data types. This was also the largest data data set I used in the class. 
    This was an interesting dataset to work with but it would have been better to analyze it later in the semester for these reasons. 
    This project taught me how to better identify good quality datasets. The SQL procedure could have been
    helpful here to help clean the dataset had I known about it earlier. There were more tools to filter and clean data
  I discovered later on that would have been useful to tackle this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this example we counted the number of strings for "subscriber" and "customer" and repressent the results graphically
    as a pie chart. We should that the overwhealming types of riders for the Citibike service are subscribers.
    In a large and complicated dataset we found the most consistent data type to answer provide easily digestible information.

  <h3>Project 2</h3>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/sscottSD/SAS-Portfolio/blob/main/project2.sas">Project 2 Code</a>
    <p>
    In project 2 our group wanted to explore the field of sports statistics. To do so we found a dataset of NBA player statistics for the 
    2021-22 season.
    </p>
    <p> 
    We wanted to see if there was a difference in teams overtime. To do thiswe tested if there was a significant difference in minutes played.
    </p>
    <p> H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 =.... μk Minutes played are similar across all team. <p>
    <p> Ha: There is a signficant difference in minutes played. </p>
    <p> Alpha: 5%  F-Statistic:.58 p-value:.9649 </p>
    <p> Fail to reject the null because .9648>.05 </p>

   <br>
   <p>
   There is not a significant difference in the minutes played per team.We can say that 
   all teams are about equally likely to play into overtime.
   </p> 
   <p>
    This project brought questions about how to how to count data depending on categorical variable. 
    Player names were duplicated in this set when they were traded. In this question it did not matter how much time an individual player played,
    only the averages for the entire team per game. In other questions we were analyzing on questions based on
    a player's categorical data we had to clean the data and combine data for each cattegory in a way that was consistent with
    the statistic.
